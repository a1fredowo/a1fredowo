# Hi there! I'm Alfredo

I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Adolfo Ibáñez University in Chile. I am passionate about rhythm games, shooters, and virtual reality. I'm also a big fan of esports.

On this profile, I will be uploading most of the assignments and projects I do at uni, along with some personal projects I work on during my free time. I hope you find something interesting here!
