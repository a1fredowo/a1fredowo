# Hi there! I'm Alfredo

I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Adolfo Ibáñez University in Chile. I am passionate about rhythm games, shooters, and virtual reality. I'm also a big fan of esports.

On this profile, I will be uploading most of the assignments and projects I do at university, and maybe some that I work on in my spare time. I hope you find something interesting here!
